# RestAPI
Making a Rest API from scratch

# Infromation
This is a school projekt to build a Restful API with the help of express. We need to use 4 endpoints with every metod(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). 

# Requirements
I only made the G requirements.

# Installation
When you want to start the project you need to use terminal -> npm i (so it will install every dependencies that needed to start up the project.)
